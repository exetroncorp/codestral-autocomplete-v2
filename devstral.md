Create a video game that mixes Space Invaders and Pong for the web.

Follow these instructions:
- There are two players one at the top and one at the bottom. The players are controling a bar to bounce a ball.
- The first player plays with the keys "a" and "d", the second with the right and left arrows.
- The invaders are located at the center of the screen. They shoud look like the ones in Space Invaders. Their goal is to shoot on the players randomly. They cannot be destroyed by the ball that pass through them. This means that invaders never die.
- The players goal is to avoid shootings from the space invaders and send the ball to the edge of the over player.
- The ball bounces on the left and right edges.
- Once the ball touch one of the player's edge, the player loses.
- Once a player is touched 3 times or more by a shooting, the player loses.
- The player winning is the last one standing.
- Display on the UI, the number of times a player touched the ball, and the remaining health.
